Not enough meals for all categories in profile                                  NotEnoughMealsAllCategoriesTest
  * Should be flagged as incomplete profile and partial plan returned (if possible)
    * No meals in database all categories
    * Some meals but not enough to complete plan (Status = Partial)
Not enough meals (3 categories), exact # of meals for remaining categories
  * Should be flagged as incomplete profile and partial plan returned (if possible)      

Exact # of meals for all categories                                             ExactNumberMealsMenuPlanTest

Not enough meals (2 categories), Exact # of meals (3 categories), 
	more than enough meals (2 categories)

	   meals = number of categories with more than enough meals)

Not enough meals (3 categories), Exact # of meals (2 categories), 
  more than enough meals (2 categories)
  *  Should return incomplete plan (because the number of categories with not enough
     meals > number of categories with more than enough meals)
     	
Exact # of meals (3 categories),  more than enough meals (4 categories)         ExactMoreThanMealsMenuPlanTest
